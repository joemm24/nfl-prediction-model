   python run_pipeline.py --full
   
   # Test specific components
   python src/fetch_data.py
   python src/build_features.py
   python src/train.py
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Code Formatting

We use `black` for code formatting:

```bash
# Install black
pip install black

# Format your code
black src/
```

### Linting

We use `flake8` for linting:

```bash
# Install flake8
pip install flake8

# Check your code
flake8 src/
```

### Type Hints

Use type hints where appropriate:

```python
def calculate_stats(df: pd.DataFrame, window: int = 4) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Calculate rolling statistics"""
    pass
```

## Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Update QUICKSTART.md if changing user-facing behavior
- Add comments for complex logic

### Docstring Format

```python
def my_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of function
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When param2 is negative
    """
    pass
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR, test:

1. **Data Pipeline**: Run `python run_pipeline.py --fetch --features`
2. **Model Training**: Run `python run_pipeline.py --train`
3. **Predictions**: Run `python run_pipeline.py --predict`
4. **Dashboard**: Launch with `streamlit run src/dashboard.py`
5. **API**: Start with `python src/api.py` and test endpoints
